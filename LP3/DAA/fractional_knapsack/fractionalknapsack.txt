
The Fractional Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack, given a weight capacity. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, where you can either take an item or leave it, in the Fractional Knapsack Problem, you can take fractions of an item, which allows for a greedy approach to be applied.

Theory
Problem Definition:

You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value.
You have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity.
You can take whole items or fractions of items.
Greedy Approach:

Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
Sort the items by this ratio in descending order.
Start adding items to the knapsack:
If the entire item fits, add it completely.
If not, take the fraction that fits and fill the knapsack to its capacity.
Steps
Calculate Value-to-Weight Ratio: For each item, compute its value divided by its weight.
Sort Items: Sort the items based on the value-to-weight ratio.
Add Items to Knapsack:
If the item can fit entirely, add it.
If not, add as much as can fit







class Item:
    def __init__(self, value, weight):
        self.value = value
        self.weight = weight
        self.ratio = value / weight

def fractional_knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    items = [Item(values[i], weights[i]) for i in range(len(values))]
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x.ratio, reverse=True)
    total_value = 0.0
    for item in items:
        if capacity == 0:
            break
        if item.weight <= capacity:
            capacity -= item.weight
            total_value += item.value
        else:
            total_value += item.ratio * capacity
            capacity = 0
    return total_value
