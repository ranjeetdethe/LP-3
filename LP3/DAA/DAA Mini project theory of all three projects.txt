#### Concept:
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, used extensively in various fields such as computer graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing. It involves multiplying two matrices to produce a third matrix, following specific mathematical rules.

#### Theory:
- **Matrix Definition**: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. For instance, a matrix \(A\) with dimensions \(m \times n\) has \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns.
- **Multiplication Rules**: To multiply two matrices \(A\) (of size \(m \times n\)) and \(B\) (of size \(n \times p\)), the number of columns in \(A\) must equal the number of rows in \(B\). The resulting matrix \(C\) will have dimensions \(m \times p\).

  The element \(C[i][j]\) in the resulting matrix is computed as:
  \[
  C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A[i][k] \times B[k][j]
  \]

#### Algorithms:
1. **Naive Algorithm**: Iteratively computes each element of the resulting matrix using three nested loops.
2. **Multithreaded Algorithm**: Improves efficiency by distributing the computation across multiple threads, either by assigning each thread to a row or to a cell of the resultant matrix.

#### Significance:
- Efficient matrix multiplication is crucial for applications in machine learning, image processing, and solving systems of linear equations.

### 2. Merge Sort

#### Concept:
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts an array or a list by dividing it into smaller subarrays, sorting those subarrays, and then merging them back together.

#### Theory:
- **Divide and Conquer**: The algorithm works by recursively dividing the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element (base case).
- **Merging**: After reaching the base case, the algorithm merges the sorted subarrays back together. This merging process involves comparing the elements of both subarrays and placing the smaller one into the result array.

#### Steps:
1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array.

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of Merge Sort is \(O(n \log n)\) in the worst, average, and best cases due to the repeated division of the array and the linear time merging process.

#### Significance:
- Merge Sort is stable and works well with large datasets. It is particularly useful for sorting linked lists and for external sorting algorithms (sorting data that cannot fit into memory).

### 3. String Matching Algorithms (Naive and Rabin-Karp)

#### Concept:
String matching involves finding occurrences of a substring (pattern) within a larger string (text). This problem is common in applications such as search engines, text editors, and DNA sequencing.

#### Theory:
1. **Naive String Matching**:
   - This algorithm checks for the pattern at each position in the text. For each position, it compares the pattern to the corresponding substring of the text.
   - **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, the time complexity is \(O(n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the length of the text and \(m\) is the length of the pattern. This occurs when every character in the text must be checked against every character in the pattern.

2. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**:
   - This algorithm uses hashing to find matches of the pattern in the text. It calculates a hash value for the pattern and for each substring of the text of the same length.
   - If the hash values match, it then performs a character-by-character check to confirm the match.
   - **Time Complexity**: The average case is \(O(n + m)\), making it efficient for searching multiple patterns simultaneously. However, it can degrade to \(O(n \cdot m)\) in the worst case due to hash collisions.

#### Significance:
- Efficient string matching algorithms are essential for text processing applications, including search functionalities in databases and search engines, plagiarism detection, and bioinformatics for analyzing genetic sequences.
