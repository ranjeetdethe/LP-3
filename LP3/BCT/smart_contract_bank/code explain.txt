This Solidity code defines a simple `Bank` smart contract that allows an account holder to deposit and withdraw funds, and to view the balance. Let's break down each part in detail:

### SPDX License Identifier
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED 
// license is important to compile our code
```
The SPDX license identifier `UNLICENSED` means that this code is not licensed under any standard open-source license, but instead, the user must accept it as unlicensed code.

### Pragma Directive
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
This line specifies the Solidity compiler version (0.8.x) for this contract. The caret (`^`) indicates compatibility with versions 0.8.0 and above, but less than 0.9.0.

### Contract Definition
```solidity
contract Bank {
```
This line defines a new contract called `Bank`. In Solidity, a contract is similar to a class in other languages and can contain variables, functions, and constructors.

### State Variables
```solidity
address public accHolder;
uint256 balance = 0;
```
- `accHolder`: Stores the Ethereum address of the account holder. `public` allows external access, and `address` is the type used to store an Ethereum address.
- `balance`: Stores the account balance. It is a `uint256` (an unsigned integer) initialized to 0.

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor() {
    accHolder = msg.sender;
}
```
The constructor is executed once when the contract is deployed. It assigns the `msg.sender` (the address that deployed the contract) to `accHolder`, making this address the initial account holder.

### `withdraw` Function
```solidity
function withdraw() payable public {
    require(msg.sender == accHolder, "You are not the account holder");
    require(balance > 0, "You don't have enough balance.");
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(balance);
    balance = 0;
}
```
- This function allows the account holder to withdraw all funds from the contract.
- `require` statements ensure that:
  - The caller is the account holder.
  - The balance is greater than 0.
- If the requirements are met, the balance is sent to the account holderâ€™s address, and `balance` is reset to 0.

### `deposit` Function
```solidity
function deposit() public payable {
    require(msg.sender == accHolder, "You are not the account holder");
    require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount should be greater than 0.");
    balance += msg.value;
}
```
- This function allows the account holder to deposit Ether into the contract.
- `require` statements ensure that:
  - The caller is the account holder.
  - The deposit amount (`msg.value`) is greater than 0.
- If the requirements are met, the deposited amount (`msg.value`) is added to `balance`.

### `showBalance` Function
```solidity
function showBalance() public view returns(uint) {
    require(msg.sender == accHolder, "You are not the account holder");
    return balance;
}
```
- This function allows the account holder to view the balance in the contract.
- The `require` statement checks if the caller is the account holder.
- If the requirement is met, it returns the current `balance`.

### Summary
- Only the account holder (the address that deployed the contract) can deposit, withdraw, or view the balance.
- `deposit` and `withdraw` functions handle deposits and withdrawals of Ether.
- `showBalance` provides the current balance.
