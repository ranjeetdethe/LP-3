This Solidity code defines a contract named `MarksManagmtSys`, which manages student records in a simple structure. Letâ€™s go through each part of the code:

### SPDX License Identifier
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
```
This means that the code does not use a standard open-source license and is considered unlicensed.

### Pragma Directive
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
```
This specifies that the contract is compatible with Solidity versions 0.7.0 and above, but less than 0.9.0.

### Contract Definition
```solidity
contract MarksManagmtSys {
```
This line defines a contract named `MarksManagmtSys`, which contains the logic for managing student records.

### Student Structure
```solidity
struct StudentStruct {
    uint ID;
    string fName;
    string lName;
    uint marks;
}
```
The `StudentStruct` structure is created to hold student details:
- `ID`: A unique identifier for each student.
- `fName`: First name of the student.
- `lName`: Last name of the student.
- `marks`: The marks obtained by the student.

### State Variables
```solidity
address owner;
uint public stdCount = 0;
StudentStruct[] stdRecords;
```
- `owner`: Stores the address of the contract owner (the one who deployed the contract).
- `stdCount`: A public counter that keeps track of the number of students added to the system.
- `stdRecords`: An array of `StudentStruct` that stores all student records.

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```
The constructor is executed once when the contract is deployed. It sets the contract owner to `msg.sender` (the address that deployed the contract).

### `addNewRecords` Function
```solidity
function addNewRecords(uint _ID,
                       string memory _fName,
                       string memory _lName,
                       uint _marks) public payable {
    stdCount = stdCount + 1;
    stdRecords.push(StudentStruct(_ID, _fName, _lName, _marks));
}
```
- This function allows anyone to add a new student record to the contract.
- Parameters:
  - `_ID`: Unique ID for the student.
  - `_fName`: First name.
  - `_lName`: Last name.
  - `_marks`: Marks obtained.
- The function increments `stdCount` by 1 each time a new record is added.
- It then adds a new `StudentStruct` instance (using the provided details) to the `stdRecords` array.

### `getAllRecords` Function
```solidity
function getAllRecords() public view returns(StudentStruct[] memory) {
    return stdRecords;
}
```
- This function returns all student records.
- The `view` keyword specifies that the function does not modify the blockchain state.
- It returns `stdRecords`, which contains all `StudentStruct` entries.

### Summary
- The contract allows storing and managing student details (ID, name, and marks).
- `addNewRecords` is used to add a new student record, and `getAllRecords` returns all records.
- `stdCount` keeps track of the number of student entries.
